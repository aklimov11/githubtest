            <p><span class="heading"> Extended Warranty is worth it on a PC or Laptop?</span></p>
              <img src="images/questions.png" class="floatLeft">
            <ul>
              <li class="maintext"> We found 90% of the computer problems are software &amp; virus related not hardware.</li>
              <li class="maintext"> Most computer shops will charge you a diagnostic fee and a backup fee might also apply in order to re-install Windows.</li>
              <li class="maintext"> Spend the money and get a good name brand instead, if you need help to pick out a system let us know.</li>
              <li class="maintext"> Most companies will only refund a percentage of the purchase  price at the time if you&rsquo;re returning the computer without warranty. Spending  money on a good warranty will protect your investment and save you money in the  long run.</li>
              <li class="maintext"> Turnaround times are important when it comes to warranty  claims. Some manufactures have to special order parts.</li>
              <li class="maintext"> When you&rsquo;re purchasing a system in a bundle, don't be afraid  to ask the cost of the warranty or the PC/Laptop by its self. </li>
              <li class="maintext"> If your still not sure give us a call and we would be glad to setup an appointment to advise you and provide consultation for your purchase. </li>

            <p class="heading"> Do I need  IN-STORE setup on my New System?</p>
             <img src="images/answer.jpg" class="floatRight">
            <ul>
              <li class="maintext"> When you buy a Name Brand Machine (Acer, Toshiba, HP, Compaq, Lenovo etc...) most of them are already pre-setup from factory. Windows is already installed, you just have to finish the install, its really easy.</li>
              <li class="maintext"> There a few thing you have to do, from picking your country, time, date and adding your name and password. That is pretty much it, one of the last steps is to create a recovery disc in case a re-install is required.</li>
              <li class="maintext"> Some companies will try to sell you in-store setup, they will not do the setup at your location. The downside to this is that  your internet setttings, email settings, printers scanner, camera may not all work.<br />
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p align="center" class="heading"> If you want it setup give us a call first we will set-up ON-SITE</p>
            <p align="center" class="subheading"> By the time we leave you know everything is working like it should <br />
