              I just wanted to take this time to thank you for your&nbsp;professional   service. Past, present and future! It&rsquo;s obvious to me why your company is   growing so fast. 
              I must say it&rsquo;s&nbsp;very hard&nbsp;to find a company today that   delivers&nbsp;such exceptional &amp; dependable&nbsp;customer service,&nbsp;vast product   knowledge&nbsp;and quality products like North Bay Computer Services Inc. Recently   you and your staff once again did an excellent job installing our new server,   software&nbsp;and&nbsp;equipment&nbsp;set up for our Dealership. Great job! we can now offer a   faster and more efficient service to our customers and vendors!<br />
              looking   forward to working with you again!<br />
              &nbsp;<br />
              Sincerely<br />

            <p class="maintext"><span class="maintext">WOW...Christm</span>as morning, I had a computer problem that needed to be repaired. I   was going to drop it off for repairs during the week to one of the major retail   stores in the city, but knowing that since it is the busy time of the year for   them. I knew that it would be there for a while.&nbsp; Then I found this company   while doing Google search. I emailed them Christmas morning (not expecting a   response for a couple of days) and I got a surprise return phone call from them   later on Christmas Day and made appt. for the next day. They came and solved the   problem right in my home without leaving my house.&nbsp; VERY courteous and   professional.&nbsp; HIGHLY recommend this company to solve big or even small computer   problems.</p>

            <p class="maintext">Let me say again that I was really impressed with your   services.&nbsp; I have always been weary of leaving my&nbsp;computer in the hands of   strangers;&nbsp;to me it seems&nbsp;akin to handing over your house keys to someone you   don't know!&nbsp; Josh was really flexible with his scheduling and was able to come   over within hours of my call (sooner if my schedule had allowed it).&nbsp; He was   very friendly and efficient.&nbsp; Your onsite service is great!&nbsp; Within 2 hours my   computer was up and running again.&nbsp;</p>
