            <p class="maintext">PC CARE PLUS is a far better value than retail stores, who charge $80 an hour or more and require you to carry your computer to them. Remember, PC CARE PLUS Inc. comes to you; it&rsquo;s a lot more confidential. There is no need to worry about the technician going through your personal files or giving your password away. You are able to see what the technician does and you get to ask questions and learn. You see what you pay for. A big benefit to using PC CARE PLUS Inc. is that we carry most parts on-site to save you time and money.</p>
            <p class="maintext">We also can arrange FREE pickup in the KW Area(reasonable fee would apply outside of the area). You also have the option to come to us, if that is more convenient for you. </p>

              <li class="maintext">We're not on commission, on a bonus structure or even a percentage, we charge a flat fee to build the computer system and we won't sell you what you don't need. </li>
              <li class="maintext">When you buy a pre-built name brand tower, alot of them have specifications that are not suited for you and you are paying for that. With us you can pick the size of the hard drive, how much RAM and the Operating System (Windows XP, PRO, 7, 8 64 bit or 32 bit). You have so much more choice. It would be like getting a custom built house with quality parts and service behind it. </li>
              <li class="maintext">Name brand computers may not contain the same name brand parts, a lot of them use the cheapest parts available to maximize profit.</li>
              <li class="maintext">When you purchase a computer from us, it will come setup with the Windows CD. We offer the setup ON-SITE where you get to test the machine before we leave. </li>
              <li class="maintext">We ONLY use legal software. </li>
              <li class="maintext">Warranty service with us, will blow away the competition. If you purchase a PC from us we carry most part in stock. Typically you can get your computer fixed the same day. Most big box stores have to order parts from the manufacturer which can take time. Waiting to get parts is unacceptable to us. </li>
